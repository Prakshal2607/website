# Hack Club's Website [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/hackclub/website.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hackclub/website)

Congratulations, you've stumbled upon Hack Club's website. Achievement get!

## Getting Started

Our website is developed using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If you don't already have it installed, do that now.

Once you've cloned the repo, run the following commands to get the basics set up:

    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose run web bundle install
    $ docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate

### Secrets

Secret keys are handled with [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro). Create `config/application.yml` containing the following keys and corresponding values.

- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Publishable key for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` - JavaScript API key for Google Maps

#### Production Secrets

The following secrets are also required for production.

- `SMTP_ADDRESS`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USERNAME`
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`
- `SMTP_DOMAIN`

#### Optional Variables

- `REFERRERS_TO_BLOCK`
  - A list of regular expressions of hostnames to block, separated by `|`. This is used to prevent [referrer spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referer_spam)
    - Examples: `.*\.spam\.com|\w+.spamwow.\w+`, `bad\.referrer\.com`

### Start server

    $ docker-compose up

The website should now be up and running!

## Deployment

If you choose to use the `Procfile` for deployment, you _must_ set the following environment variables to appropriate values:

- `PORT`
- `RAILS_ENV`
